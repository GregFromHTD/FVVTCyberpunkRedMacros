This is a set of macros I made to help me run Cyberpunk RED using the system for FoundryVTT build by Gerdofal.

There is a macro for each skill on the character sheet. They are all universal chat commands that will roll the relevent stat on any token you have
selected in the scene. They will not work when not in a scene or no token is selected. 

Additionally there's an Interface roll (and a Sword roll) that is correct to the book rules as a bandaid fix until Gerdofal finishes the Netrunning system. 

There are simply damage push-button macros for 1d6-5d6 to cover all weapons/programs.

Additionally there are 4 macros, 1 for each armor slot currently on the character sheet. Each of these macros will ablate the related armor by 1 for each press.
If your edgerunner has light armor jack in their first armor slot, and you hit the Ablate Armor 1 macro, the armor value will shift from 11 to 10. If you set your
token up to display this armor as a resource bar, it makes tracking armor in combat much easier. Hope this helps you! In all liklihood I'll update this compendium 
as Gerdofal fleshes out the Cyberpunk RED System. Hope you're enjoying the new book!
